# __Short list of useful command-line tools__

## __Git commands__

- `git clone <<repository address>>`: you make a copy of the repository in your computer (remember to choose a folder where you want to work and have access to the repository files);
- `git pull`: inside the repository folder you can run it to download any updates I made in the repository.

## __For Windows command prompt__

- `cd <<folder name>>`: you go inside the folder;
- `cd..`: you go to a folder before folder you are;
- `dir`: you can see the content of a folder (the files already there);

## __For UNIX (MacOS/Linux) terminal__

- `cd <<folder name>>`: you go inside the folder;
- `cd ..`: you go to a folder before folder you are;
- `ls`: you can see the content of a folder (the files already there);
 
Remember: in UNIX OS's, the folders are defined by `/`; In windows, they are defined by `\` (confusing??).
